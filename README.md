Miscellaneous Matlab scripts I wrote for Speech Processing at UNSW

Current scripts:
- plot_spectra.m - Alternative to the built-in freqz function to plot magnitude and phase of a signal/system
- spect_out.m - Alternative to the built-in spectrogram function to plot the Short Time Fourier Transform of a signal/system
- fft_out.m - Alternative to the built-in function, radix-2 FFT only
